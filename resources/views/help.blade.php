<h1>What has been randomized?</h1>
<div class="well">
	<ul>
		<li>Almost all unique item locations</li>
		<li>Pendants and Crystals (check your map!)</li>
		<li>The medallion required to open Misery Mire and Turtle Rock</li>
		<li>Enemy drops and pull prizes (e.g. trees)</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h1>What has stayed the same?</h1>
<div class="well">
	<ul>
		<li>Link’s Uncle still gives you the Fighter’s Sword (except in Open mode).</li>
		<li>The Great Faerie fountain in Lake Hylia.</li>
		<li>All shops throughout Hyrule.</li>
		<li>The archery game and various rupee chest games.</li>
		<li>Small keys underneath pots or held by enemies.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h1>What differences are there from the original game?</h1>
<div class="well">
	<p>There are a few changes from the original game which enhance gameplay and prevent you getting stuck. The Japanese
		1.0 version is used as a base ROM because it allows use of some exclusive glitches in some of the advanced game
		modes. You may see some Japanese text but this will eventually all be removed.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You no longer need the Lamp to push the bookshelf during the prologue and you can now see in
			dark rooms in the Sewers even without the Lamp (except in Open mode).</li>
		<li>You are never required to navigate through dark rooms so if you find yourself in total
			darkness then it’s guaranteed that you can find the Lamp elsewhere (in No Major Glitches).</li>
		<li>You can toggle between items which share the same slot in the menu by pressing Y. For example
			you can now hold both the Shovel and Flute and switch between them.</li>
		<li>The sub-menu for the Bottles no longer automatically opens and you can open it with X
			or toggle between them with Y.</li>
		<li>The water levels within Swamp Palace will always revert to being drained when you exit
			the overworld screen. This prevents you accidentally drowning keys underwater and getting stuck!</li>
		<li>The file select screen has a random row of symbols at the top. These are a unique identifier
			for each seed generated and do not have any other relevance.</li>
		<li>The Fat Faerie does not upgrade your Sword or Bow but her cave now contains two randomized
			chests which account for her usual upgrades having been shuffled into the mix.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h1>Hints</h1>
<div class="well">
	<ul>
		<li>Agahnim's barrier can be bypassed with the Magic Cape or destroyed with an upgraded sword.</li>
		<li>Desert Palace can be reached from Misery Mire even without the Book of Mudora.</li>
		<li>Bombos burns things as well as the Fire Rod which is useful in Ice Palace.</li>
		<li>You can cross small gaps by rebounding off of walls or objects.</li>
		<li>Sahasrahla gives you his item when you speak to him with the Pendant of Courage.</li>
		<li>The Super Bomb spawns when you have acquired crystals 5 and 6.</li>
		<li>The digging game item is guaranteed to be gotten by the 30th dig.</li>
		<li>The chest game item is guaranteed to be gotten on the 1st attempt (can be 1st or 2nd chest).</li>
		<li>The Smith and the Purple chest will stay following you through Save and Quit</li>
	</ul>
